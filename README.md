# Distributed-System-Design-using-HBase

Project Learnings:

1. Performed some Analytics on the 1.5 GB Dataset by writing various queries on HBASE.
2. Understood the Hadoop Ecosystem and their components
3. Set up Hbase on Cloudera Platform.
4. Performed CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete) on the Hbase
5. Investigated various Distributed System Aspects including 
  a. Scalability: By adding multiple Hbase Region servers
  b. Fault Tolerance: By examining Hadoop fault-tolerance and replication mechanism
  c. Data Replication: By investigating HDFS data replication mechanism
  d. Data Consistency: By performing concurrent CRUD operations
  
6. Set Up HBase on Amazon EMR instance and performed the Big Data Analytics on the dataset by writing various queries on Hbase set up on AWS.
